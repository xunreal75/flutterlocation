# Install on iOS

## Minimum deployment target

In order to use Location, you need to set your minimum deployment target to iOS 13.0 or later.
Change the second line in your `ios/Podfile` into:

```
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

## Info.plist

In order to request location permissions, you need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>The app needs the location</string>
```

The string will appear in the popup when the user is asked to grant location permissions.

## Background location

If you want to receive background location, you need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>The app needs the location</string>
```

The string will appear in the popup when the user is asked to grant background location permissions.

You also need to activate Background mode for your Runner. Open XCode and go to "Signing & Capabilities".
Add the "Background Modes" section and add "Location updates" to the list.
